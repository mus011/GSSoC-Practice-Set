Learning GitHub involves understanding version control concepts and getting familiar with the GitHub platform. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

    Understand Version Control:
    Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of version control. Version control systems like Git help track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of your project.

    Install Git:
    If you haven't already, install Git on your computer. You can download it from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
